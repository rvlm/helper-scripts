`rvlm.labhelpers.trivia`: trivial things Python lacks
=====================================================

This is a helper module, providing some trivial, but still useful and
convenient helper functions, which are absent from the standard library for
some reason. Not all of them may be a good idea, thought, and none of them
claims to be the pythonicâ„¢ way to do things.

Many of the module function try to resemble things widely used in functional
languages, like :func:`head`.

    Wraps `func` with argument unpacker. Thus the function can be called with

    This feature is particularly useful with `numpy.apply_along_axis` function
    which expect its function to take a single list as argument.

    :return:     Wrapper function, taking a single list parameter.
